## 🔱 About This Fork

This is a community fork of **[7Sageer/sublink-worker](https://github.com/7Sageer/sublink-worker)** maintained at **[WayneWu98/sublink-worker](https://github.com/WayneWu98/sublink-worker)**. All credit for the original project goes to the upstream authors.

**Differences from upstream (at the time of writing):**

- **Short-link token auth (v2.5+)** — `/shorten-v2` returns `{code, token}`; overwriting an existing short code requires the matching `X-Shortlink-Token` header.
- **Short code loader UI + `/resolve` read auth (v2.6+)** — Explicit "Load from Code" button replaces the removed paste-auto-parse flow; `/resolve` now authenticates new-format entries.
- **Surge `#!MANAGED-CONFIG` short-URL preservation (v2.7+)** — Surge configs fetched via a short link embed the short URL in `MANAGED-CONFIG` so short-code remaps propagate without client reconfiguration.
- **Rule groups expansion (v2.9+)** — 15 extended built-in rule groups, subscribable Custom RuleSets backed by a provider dictionary (MetaCubeX / blackmatrix7 / Loyalsoldier / ACL4SSR / custom URL) that each register their own proxy group, Custom Rules outbound as a dropdown of valid targets, configurable Fall Back default, and `customRuleSets` + `fallback_outbound` share-URL params.
- **Per-rule `no-resolve` toggle for Custom Rules IP CIDR (v2.9.2+)** — Upstream hard-codes `no-resolve` on every user-defined `IP-CIDR` rule, which silently bypasses the rule whenever the client hands the rule engine a hostname instead of an IP (common with Surge's system proxy / HTTPS CONNECT). A switch next to the IP CIDR field drops that flag per rule so the client resolves DNS and the rule actually matches. Default off preserves upstream behavior. Affects Clash / mihomo / Surge output.

See the Changelog below for detailed release notes and migration guidance for each change.

## ⚠️ Data Retention Notice

**Short links and stored configs persist your data, including credentials, to the backend KV store.** Before using this tool — especially a public-facing instance — understand exactly what gets written:

### `/shorten-v2` (and the web UI's "Shorten" button)

Submitting a subscription for shortening writes the **full query string you submitted** to KV under the generated short code. That query string includes the `config` parameter, which carries:

- Raw proxy URIs (`vmess://`, `vless://`, `ss://`, `hysteria2://`, `trojan://`, `tuic://`, …) — these encode **server addresses, UUIDs, passwords, and pre-shared keys**.
- HTTP/HTTPS subscription URLs you pasted in.
- Your selected rules and custom rule sets.

Storage format (v2.5+): `{ "q": "<full query string>", "t": "<32-hex token>" }`. Legacy entries (pre-v2.5) store the raw query string only.

### `POST /config` (custom base config upload)

Uploading a custom Sing-Box / Clash / Surge base config writes the **entire config body** to KV under a generated ID. If your base config contains account credentials, policy rules, or DNS settings you consider private, they are persisted as-is.

### Where "the backend KV" actually is

- **Self-hosted (Cloudflare Workers / Vercel KV / Upstash Redis / local Redis via Docker):** data lives in the KV backend **you** configured. Retention, access, and deletion are your responsibility.
- **Public instance:** data lives in the KV of whoever operates that instance. Treat any public instance as you would any untrusted third party that now holds your proxy credentials.

### TTL

Short links and stored configs respect the optional TTL configured via `shortLinkTtlSeconds` / `configTtlSeconds`. If unset, entries persist indefinitely until manually deleted.

### Recommendation

If your subscription contains credentials you consider sensitive, **self-host** rather than using a public instance, and configure a reasonable TTL.

## 🚀 Quick Start

- **Docker Compose**: `docker compose up -d` (includes Redis)

## ✨ Features

### Supported Protocols
ShadowSocks • VMess • VLESS • Hysteria2 • Trojan • TUIC • Snell¹

¹ Snell outputs natively to Surge and Clash (Mihomo). Sing-Box has no native Snell outbound — Snell nodes are dropped with a console warning.

### Client Support
Sing-Box • Clash • Xray/V2Ray • Surge

### Input Support
- Base64 subscriptions
- HTTP/HTTPS subscriptions
- Full configs (Sing-Box JSON, Clash YAML, Surge INI)
- `snell://` share-links (tool-internal format — see [Snell](#snell) below)

### Snell

- **Input:**
  - Surge config block (paste full text containing `[Proxy]` section)
  - Clash YAML (`type: snell` node, supports `obfs-opts: {mode, host}`)
  - `snell://` share-link — *tool-internal format, not a community standard*:
    ```
    snell://<url-encoded-psk>@<host>:<port>?version=<n>&obfs=<http|tls>&obfs-host=<h>&tfo=<bool>&reuse=<bool>&udp=<bool>#<name>
    ```
    Only `psk` and `host:port` are required. `snell://` URLs from other tools (Surgio, etc.) use different conventions and are not guaranteed to parse.
- **Output:** Surge ✓ native · Clash (Mihomo) ✓ native · Sing-Box ✗ dropped with a console warning.

### Core Capabilities
- Import subscriptions from multiple sources
- Generate fixed/random short links (KV-based)
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Flexible API for script automation
- Multi-language support (Chinese, English, Persian, Russian)
- Web interface with predefined rule sets and customizable policy groups

## 🧩 Rule Groups

### Extended rule groups

15 additional rule groups (Discord, WhatsApp, Signal, Line, Zoom, Spotify, News, Reddit, Twitch, Pixiv, Developer, OpenAI, Anthropic, Speedtest, Porn) are available behind a "Show more rule groups" disclosure in the Rule Selection card. They are not included in any preset; check them individually when you want them. Presets (`minimal`, `balanced`, `comprehensive`) are unchanged.

### Custom RuleSets

Subscribe to any public rule-set file and register it as an independent proxy group. Expand **Custom RuleSets** under Advanced Options and add an entry:

- **Provider**: pick from MetaCubeX, blackmatrix7, Loyalsoldier, ACL4SSR, or `Custom URL`
- **File name** (non-`Custom URL` providers): file stem such as `reddit`, `spotify`, `Notion` — URL is derived automatically for sing-box/Clash/Surge
- **Custom URL**: supply one URL per format (sing-box `.srs`, Clash `.mrs`/`.yaml`, Surge `.list`). Only formats you fill in will emit
- **Type**: `site` for domain rule-sets, `ip` for IP CIDR rule-sets
- **Outbound**: proxy group for matched traffic (`Proxy`, `Direct`, `Reject`, or any selector name)

Entries round-trip through share links via the `customRuleSets` URL parameter. Providers that do not publish a given format (e.g. ACL4SSR has no sing-box `.srs`) are silently skipped on export — mixed-format subscriptions stay valid.

### Fall Back outbound

The Fall Back selector's default member (what unmatched traffic uses until the user switches) is now configurable from Advanced Options → General Settings. Choose `Node Select` (default), `DIRECT`, or `REJECT`.

## 🗒️ Changelog

### v2.10.2

- **Surge `DEVICE:device_name` outbound for custom rules and rule sets.** A new "Surge Devices" section lets you declare Ponte device names (e.g. `tower`, `my-iphone`); declared names then appear as `DEVICE:<name>` options in the Custom Rules and Custom Rule Sets outbound dropdowns. In the Surge config, the `DEVICE:` policy is emitted verbatim — no wrapper proxy group — so traffic routes directly to the named device (`DOMAIN-SUFFIX,work.com,DEVICE:my-iphone` and `RULE-SET,<url>,DEVICE:tower`). Clash and Sing-Box have no equivalent; rules and rule sets with a `DEVICE:` outbound are silently dropped from those configs (no wrapper group, no rule-provider, no orphan rule-set declaration). The device list is persisted in the subconverter URL alongside `customRules` and `customRuleSets`, restored before either of those so cross-references survive a round-trip.

### v2.10.1

Sync six bug fixes from upstream `7Sageer/sublink-worker`. None of these affect the existing Snell support added in v2.10.0.

- **Restore full proxy choices in Custom Rule selectors** (#371). Custom Rule groups (e.g. "YouTube → MyProxy") now include individual nodes alongside the existing Node Select / Auto Select / Manual Switch / DIRECT chain — previously the node list was missing, so users could only route through aggregate selectors.
- **Preserve subscription-userinfo on `/xray`** (#362, #382). The xray endpoint now passes the upstream `subscription-userinfo` HTTP header through to the client, matching the existing behaviour of `/singbox` / `/clash` / `/surge`. Surge / Stash / Loon clients in xray mode now show traffic and expiry information again.
- **Better remote subscription decoding**. `decodeContent` no longer base64-decodes payloads that are already plain Surge / Clash / Sing-Box config or `ss://`/`vmess://`/etc. share-link lists, avoiding garbled output. Surge config text is now recognized in `detectFormat`.
- **Reject empty Clash proxy groups** (#378). User-supplied `url-test` / `fallback` groups with empty `proxies: []` and no `use:` references now produce a 400 error with the offending group name, instead of being silently filled with all available nodes.
- **Sing-Box 1.11+ schema** (#380). Removed the legacy `{type:'block', tag:'REJECT'}` special outbound and the deprecated `independent_cache` field from the base Sing-Box config. Ad Block rules now emit `action: reject` route actions (1.11+ idiom) rather than routing to a REJECT outbound. Selector groups in sing-box no longer include `REJECT`. A new sanitization pass strips legacy `block` / `dns` outbound references from user-uploaded base configs.
- **Stable auto-provider names** (#379). Provider auto-tags are now `_auto_provider_<base36 hash>` derived deterministically from the source URL (FNV-1a 32-bit), instead of `_auto_provider_1` / `_2` indexes that shifted on every build. Duplicate URLs are deduplicated; hash collisions get `_2` / `_3` suffixes. Affects both Clash `proxy-providers` and Sing-Box `outbound_providers`. Cached providers will be re-downloaded once after the upgrade.

### v2.10.0

- **Snell protocol support.** Parses Snell nodes from Surge config blocks, Clash YAML (`type: snell` with `obfs-opts`), and a new tool-internal `snell://` share-link form (`snell://<psk>@<host>:<port>?version=&obfs=&obfs-host=&tfo=&reuse=&udp=#name`). Outputs natively to Surge and Clash (Mihomo); Sing-Box has no native Snell outbound, so Snell nodes are dropped with a console warning and excluded from selector groups. The `snell://` URL is *not* a community standard — URLs from other tools (Surgio, etc.) follow different conventions and are not guaranteed to round-trip.

### v2.9.2

- **Per-rule `no-resolve` toggle for Custom Rules IP CIDR.** Upstream emits every user-defined `IP-CIDR` rule with `no-resolve` hard-coded, so the rule silently never matches when the client evaluates rules against a hostname instead of an IP (common with Surge's system proxy / HTTPS CONNECT — traffic falls through to Final). This fork adds a switch next to each custom rule's IP CIDR field that drops the `no-resolve` flag when enabled, letting the client resolve DNS so the IP rule can actually match. Default off preserves upstream behavior. Affects Clash / mihomo / Surge output; sing-box has no equivalent flag and is unchanged.

### v2.9.1

- **Bug fix**: custom rules / rule sets named after a reserved outbound (e.g. `DIRECT`, `REJECT`, `PASS`) no longer generate a same-named selector group. Surge previously rejected the config with "策略组不可以使用内部策略名"; other clients silently shadowed the built-in action.
- Dropped the redundant `DIRECT = direct` line from Surge's `[Proxy]` section.

### v2.9.0

- **15 extended rule groups** behind a collapsed disclosure (Discord, WhatsApp, Signal, Line, Zoom, Spotify, News, Reddit, Twitch, Pixiv, Developer, OpenAI, Anthropic, Speedtest, Porn). Presets are unchanged.
- **Custom RuleSets** — subscribe to public rule-set files (MetaCubeX / blackmatrix7 / Loyalsoldier / ACL4SSR / custom URL). Each entry becomes its own proxy group; the form's `Outbound` field is that group's default member. Share-link round-trip via `customRuleSets`.
- **Custom Rules outbound** is now a dropdown of valid outbounds (built-in + selected rule groups + custom rule sets) instead of a free-text group name.
- **Fall Back outbound** preference (Node Select / DIRECT / REJECT).
- Global `<select>` chevron + consistent padding, animated row add/delete, auto-reset of referenced outbounds when the source is removed.

### v2.7

**Surge `#!MANAGED-CONFIG` short-URL preservation.** Surge responses previously embedded the long converter URL (e.g. `/surge?config=...`) in their `#!MANAGED-CONFIG` directive.

- When a Surge client subscribes via a short link (`/s/:code`), the returned config's `#!MANAGED-CONFIG` line now points at the **short URL** (e.g. `https://<host>/s/abc123`). The client stays pinned to the short link; subsequent `/shorten-v2` overwrites of the same code are automatically picked up on the next client refresh, with no manual reconfiguration.
- Direct access to `/surge?config=...` (no short link involved) is unchanged — the long request URL is written into `MANAGED-CONFIG`.
- A new optional query parameter `sub_url` is accepted by `/surge`. It must be a **same-origin** absolute URL; cross-origin or malformed values are silently ignored (stripped from the fallback URL) to prevent malicious URL override.

**One-time migration for existing subscribers:** Surge clients already pinned to the long URL (from an earlier build) will not auto-migrate. Re-enter the short URL in Surge once to pick up the new behavior.

### v2.6

**Short code loader UI + `/resolve` read authentication.** Building on v2.5's token system.

- **New UI entry point**: a "Load from Code" button appears to the left of Paste/Clear on the main input. It opens a modal accepting a short code and optional token, then loads the original subscription configuration back into the form and captures the token so a subsequent "Shorten" call overwrites the same short code.
- **`/resolve` is now conditionally authenticated**: entries created under v2.5+ require the matching `X-Shortlink-Token` header. Missing token → 401 (reason `missing`). Wrong token → 403 (reason `mismatch`). Legacy entries (created before v2.5) remain anonymously readable.
- **Auto-parse of pasted short URLs has been removed.** Pasting a short URL (e.g. `https://<host>/b/<code>`) into the main input textarea no longer fetches and populates the form. Use the new "Load from Code" button instead.
- **`/b/:code`, `/c/:code`, `/x/:code`, `/s/:code` redirect endpoints are unchanged** — they continue to resolve anonymously so existing short links on the open internet keep working.

Migration: any external tooling that called `/resolve` on a new-format short code must now supply `X-Shortlink-Token`.

### v2.5

**Short link token authentication** on the `/shorten-v2` endpoint.

- **Response is now JSON** (previously `text/plain`). Shape: `{ "code": "<shortcode>", "token": "<32-hex-token>" }`.
- **Overwriting an existing short code requires** sending the `X-Shortlink-Token: <token>` header. The token is returned exactly once, on creation — save it.
- **Legacy short links** (created before this version) are tokenless. The first caller who references such a short code will claim it and receive a fresh token; after that, subsequent overwrites require that token.
- **403 responses** (JSON `{ error, reason }` with `reason` being `missing` or `mismatch`) are returned when authorization fails.

Migration: external scripts that read `/shorten-v2` response as text must parse JSON and handle the new `token` field.
